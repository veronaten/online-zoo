Live demo: https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/veronaten-JSFE2021Q1/online-zoo/pages/landing/

This project is not finished yet, it is still being developed.
The idea of the project is a platform, an online zoo, where you can watch live animals, choose those that you liked the most and buy them food. After the purchase, you can see how it will eat this food.

I made this project using HTML, CSS. 
Added several sliders, a modal window using native JavaScript. 
On the Map page of the application I learned how to use drag-and-drop.
